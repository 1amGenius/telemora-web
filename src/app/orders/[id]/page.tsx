/**
 * Order Details Page Component
 *
 * This file is responsible for implementing the **Order Details Page**, where users
 * review their orders and proceed with the **payment process**. This is a **business-critical page**,
 * as this is where we **generate revenue** through **sales commissions**.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * The primary goal of this page is to **encourage users to complete their payment**
 * while providing clear information about the order's status.
 *
 * ## Order Data Structure
 * ```ts
 * export interface Order {
 *   id: number;
 *   buyer: User;
 *   stores: Store;
 *   status: OrderStatus;
 *   items: OrderItem[];
 *   shipment: OrderShipment;
 *   payment: Payment;
 *   totalAmount: number;
 *   deliveryDate: Date;
 *   createdAt: Date;
 *   updatedAt: Date;
 * }
 *
 * export interface Payment {
 *   id: string;
 *   paymentId: string;
 *   order: Order;
 *   user: User;
 *   amount: string;
 *   status: PaymentStatus;
 *   transactionHash: string;
 *   fromWalletAddress: string;
 *   toWalletAddress: string;
 *   gasFee: string;
 *   commission: string;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Payment Flow
 * - If an order **has not been paid**, display a **prominent "Pay Now" button**.
 * - The user is redirected to **Ton Wallet** to approve the transaction.
 * - The payment request is sent to the server:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export interface CreatePaymentDto {
 *   orderId?: string;
 *   amount: string;
 *   fromWalletAddress?: string;
 *   toWalletAddress?: string;
 *   transactionHash?: string;
 *   gasFee?: string;
 *   commission?: string;
 * }
 * ```
 * - The server verifies the payment, updates the order, and confirms the transaction.
 *
 * ## Order Status Tracking
 * - Display **color-coded status badges** for order processing.
 * - If the order **is being shipped**, show:
 *   - **Courier service name** & **tracking number**.
 *   - **Estimated delivery date**.
 *   - A clickable **tracking link**.
 *
 * ## UI/UX Guidelines
 * - Use **HeroUI components** for status indicators, buttons, and modals.
 * - Implement **TailwindCSS** for custom UI elements.
 * - Ensure **mobile responsiveness** with a clean checkout experience.
 * - Provide **real-time updates** on payment and order processing.
 *
 * ## Additional Enhancements
 * - **Push Notifications:** Alert users if payment is pending for too long.
 * - **Progress Tracker:** Display a visual timeline of order status.
 * - **Auto-refreshing Status:** Fetch updated payment status dynamically.
 *
 * TODO: Implement a seamless checkout page that ensures users complete their payment efficiently.
