## **Implementation Guide for Product Details Page in Next.js 14**

### **Introduction**
This document provides a standardized implementation guide for frontend developers working on the **Product Details Page** in a mobile-only web application using **Next.js 14**. This page is a **critical element for user conversion**, directly impacting revenue generation through **sales commissions**.

The **primary goal** of this page is to **persuade users** to purchase a product or service by:
- Presenting **clear, compelling product information**.
- **Building trust** through store details, reviews, and transparency.
- Encouraging users to **add products to their order** and **proceed to checkout**.

The backend is fully implemented, and API endpoints are available for retrieving product details.

## **General Guidelines**
- Use **Next.js 14 App Router** for optimal routing and performance.
- Ensure **mobile-first responsive design**.
- Follow accessibility best practices (**ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, proper contrast ratios**).
- Utilize **server-side rendering (SSR)** or **static site generation (SSG)** when applicable.
- Implement a **modular component-based approach**.
- Use **HeroUI components** wherever possible.
- **Do not use raw CSS files**; styling should be handled through HeroUI or TailwindCSS.

## **Page Implementation Checklist**

### **1. Page Initialization**
- Ensure the page follows the directory structure (`app/product/[id]/page.tsx`).
- Import required models and types from the existing data layer.
- Retrieve **product data dynamically** based on the product ID.

### **2. Product Data Structure**

The server provides product data in the following format:

```ts
export interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description?: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  store: Store;
  productType: ProductType;
  attributes: ProductAttribute[];
  variants: ProductVariant[];
  reviews: Review[];
  downloadLink?: string;
  stock?: number;
  isApproved: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### **3. Key Design Considerations**

#### **Compelling Visuals**
- Display the **product image** prominently with zoom capabilities.
- Ensure **price & key details** are instantly visible.
- Provide a **clear CTA button (“Buy Now”)** at the top and bottom of the page.

#### **Trust & Transparency**
- Show **store information** to build credibility.
- Display **user reviews** with a clear breakdown of ratings.
- Highlight if the product is **approved** by the platform.

#### **Optimized Purchase Flow**
- Allow users to **select variants** (if available).
- If the **product is digital**, show the **download process** after purchase.
- If the **product is physical**, display **shipping & stock information**.
- Show an **"Add to Cart" button** leading users to **checkout in the Orders Page**.

#### **Seamless Checkout Integration**
- After adding a product to an order, **display a checkout button**.
- Redirect users to the **Order Details Page** (`app/orders/[id]/page.tsx`) to finalize payment.

### **4. UI/UX Guidelines**
- Use **HeroUI** pre-built components for a polished design.
- Implement **TailwindCSS** for any custom elements.
- Ensure a **mobile-friendly layout** with clear call-to-actions (CTAs).
- Provide **real-time updates** on stock & availability.

### **5. Additional Enhancements**
- **Social Proof:** Display trending or frequently bought products.
- **Product Recommendations:** Show similar products to increase engagement.
- **Animated Transitions:** Use smooth interactions to enhance user experience.

## **Conclusion**
By following this guide, frontend developers can ensure a **high-converting product details page** that seamlessly leads users to checkout, increasing engagement and revenue. Always refer to the latest Next.js documentation and project-specific requirements when implementing new features.
