/**
 * Store Details Page (Mobile-Only)
 *
 * This page displays detailed information about a store when a user selects it from the store list.
 * Users can view store information, interact with its content, and (if authorized) manage the store.
 *
 * **Sections & Features:**
 *
 * 1. **Header:**
 *    - Displays the **store name** and **logo**.
 *    - Includes a **share button** to copy/store the store’s link.
 *    - If the user is the **owner or an admin**, a **store edit button** is available.
 *
 * 2. **General Store Information:**
 *    - Short **description** of the store.
 *    - **Category** (from `StoreCategories`).
 *    - **Working hours** (if provided).
 *    - **Contact details** (phone number, email, social media links).
 *    - **Store reputation** (rating or score if applicable).
 *
 * 3. **Store Products:**
 *    - Displays a **scrollable product list**.
 *    - The first few products are shown with a **“View All”** button for full access.
 *    - If the user is an **admin or owner**, a **"Add New Product"** button is available.
 *
 * 4. **Recent Orders (Restricted to Admins & Owner):**
 *    - Displays **recent orders** in a compact format.
 *    - Provides access to order details.
 *
 * 5. **Bottom Actions:**
 *    - If the user is the **store owner**, they see a **"Delete Store"** button.
 *    - A possible **“Visit Store”** link (if applicable).
 *
 * **Implementation Considerations:**
 * - **Mobile-optimized UI**: This app is mobile-only, so all layouts and interactions should be designed for small screens.
 * - **Role-based visibility**: Features like **editing, order management, and store deletion** should only be visible to authorized users.
 * - **Performance optimization**: Use **lazy loading** or **pagination** for products/orders if the dataset is large.
 * - **HeroUI-first design**: Use HeroUI components whenever possible.
 * - **Fallback to TailwindCSS** if necessary, but avoid raw CSS.
 * - **State management**: Ensure store data persists during navigation.
 *
 * **API Endpoint:**
 * Fetch store details from: `${API_BASE_URL}/stores/{storeId}`
