/**
 * Orders Page Component
 *
 * This file is responsible for implementing the **Orders Page**, where users can track
 * their purchases and manage their orders. Since our platform is a **marketplace**,
 * every user can have both **buyer** and **seller** roles. This page focuses on
 * the **buyer’s perspective**, allowing them to track their orders from different stores.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * The main goal of this page is to provide a **clear and structured overview** of
 * all user orders, helping them track their status, payments, and shipments efficiently.
 * Users should be able to:
 * - View a **list of all orders** categorized by status.
 * - Track **shipment progress** for physical products.
 * - Monitor **payment status** and complete pending payments if necessary.
 * - Access order details for a more comprehensive breakdown.
 *
 * ## Order Data Structure
 * The server provides order data in the following format:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export interface Order {
 *   id: number;
 *   buyer: User;
 *   store: Store;
 *   status: OrderStatus;
 *   items: OrderItem[];
 *   shipment: OrderShipment;
 *   payment: Payment;
 *   totalAmount: number;
 *   deliveryDate: Date;
 *   createdAt: Date;
 *   updatedAt: Date;
 * }
 *
 * export interface OrderItem {
 *   id: number;
 *   product: Product;
 *   quantity: number;
 *   totalPrice: number;
 * }
 *
 * export enum OrderStatus {
 *   PENDING = 'pending',
 *   CONFIRMED = 'confirmed',
 *   PROCESSING = 'processing',
 *   SHIPPED = 'shipped',
 *   DELIVERED = 'delivered',
 *   COMPLETED = 'completed',
 *   CANCELED = 'canceled',
 *   REFUNDED = 'refunded',
 * }
 *
 * export interface OrderShipment {
 *   id: number;
 *   trackingNumber: string;
 *   courierService: string;
 *   deliveryEstimate: Date;
 *   shippedAt: Date;
 * }
 *
 * export enum PaymentStatus {
 *   PENDING = 'pending',
 *   PROCESSING = 'processing',
 *   COMPLETED = 'completed',
 *   FAILED = 'failed',
 *   REFUNDED = 'refunded',
 * }
 *
 * export interface Payment {
 *   id: string;
 *   paymentId: string;
 *   order: Order;
 *   user: User;
 *   amount: string;
 *   status: PaymentStatus;
 *   transactionHash: string;
 *   fromWalletAddress: string;
 *   toWalletAddress: string;
 *   gasFee: string;
 *   commission: string;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Page Structure & Features

 *
 * - **Order Status Tracking**

 *   - Users should be able to **track their package** via the courier’s website.
 *

 *
 * ## UX/UI Guidelines

 * - Use a **clean and mobile-friendly design** with clear call-to-actions (CTAs).
 * - Provide **real-time updates** on order status and shipment tracking where possible.
 * - Maintain **responsive performance** with pagination or lazy-loading for large order lists.
 *
 * ## Additional Enhancements
 * - **Search & Filter Options:** Allow users to filter by order status, store, or date.
 * - **Notifications & Alerts:** Notify users when their order status changes.
 * - **Order Summary:** Provide insights into total spending, active orders, and refunds.
 *
 * TODO: Implement a user-friendly orders page that allows buyers to track their purchases,
 *       monitor payments, and view order statuses in an intuitive and structured manner.
