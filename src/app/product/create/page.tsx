/**
 * Create Product Page Component
 *
 * This file is responsible for implementing the product creation page.
 * Store owners use this page to add new products to their store.
 *
 * ## Purpose
 * This page provides a form where users can enter product details and submit them to the server.
 * The submitted data follows the structure below:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export interface CreateProductDto {
 *   name: string;
 *   price: number;
 *   description?: string;
 *   imageUrl: string;
 *   productType: ProductType;
 *   downloadLink?: string;
 *   stock?: number;
 *   attributes?: CreateProductAttributeDto[];
 *   variants?: CreateProductVariantDto[];
 * }
 *
 * export interface CreateProductAttributeDto {
 *   attributeName: string;
 *   attributeValue: string;
 * }
 *
 * export interface CreateProductVariantDto {
 *   variantName: string;
 *   variantValue: string;
 *   additionalPrice?: number;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Required Fields
 * To create a product, the user must provide:
 * - A **product name**
 * - A **price** (in TON cryptocurrency)
 * - A **brief description**
 * - A **product image**
 * - A **product type** (which affects additional fields)
 *
 * ## Product Types
 * The product type significantly impacts the userâ€™s form experience:
 *
 * ```ts
 * export enum ProductType {
 *   PHYSICAL = 'physical',
 *   DIGITAL = 'digital',
 *   SERVICE = 'service',
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * - **Physical products** require stock management.
 * - **Digital products** must include a **download link**.
 * - **Services** may not require stock or digital delivery options.
 *
 * The UI should dynamically enable/disable fields based on the selected product type.
 *
 * ## Attributes & Variants
 * The user can add **attributes** (e.g., color, size) and **variants** (e.g., different sizes with different prices).
 * This section requires a well-designed, user-friendly interface to help store owners accurately define their product options.
 *
 * ## UX Considerations
 * - Ensure **clear instructions** so sellers know exactly how to fill out each field.
 * - Implement **dynamic validation** to prevent errors (e.g., missing fields, incorrect formats).
 * - The form should be **intuitive and easy to use** while preventing confusion for potential buyers.
 *
 * ## UI/UX Guidelines
 * - Use pre-built **HeroUI** components whenever possible.
 * - If custom components are necessary, implement them using **TailwindCSS** (avoid raw CSS).
 * - Maintain a **minimal and clean** design focused on **user-friendliness**.
 * - Ensure the entire UI is **mobile-friendly** with an optimized form layout.
 *
 * TODO: Implement a form-based UI to allow store owners to create new products with dynamic fields
 *       based on product type while ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience.
